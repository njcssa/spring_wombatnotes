![](/gifs/day10/bubblesort.gif)

- use setup 7
- remember that the bubble sort is about swapping until the biggest number is in the correct location on the right side of the list
    - on the first loop, the sort should end once the biggest number is in the last index
    - the second loop should end when the second biggest number is at the second to last index
    - and so on...



## Homework:

Continue on classwork if it's not finished. Otherwise, no homework. You should spend at least an hour on the homework and you are welcome to work longer than that. Be prepared to tell your teachers what progress you made at home.
