# Day 2


## Topics:

- 5-10 minutes of going over homework
- 5 minute review of what we did last class
- 5-10 minutes going over built-in wombat functions
- variables in python
- signing up for repl.it


## Notes:

### 1.1 variables:

- variables allow the computer to store information that can be used later
- variables need a name and information to store
- a variable name should be descriptive but not too long
- example of a variable ```var = 10``` which means that the variable var holds the integer 10
- a variable's value can change by doing the following ```var = 5``` -> now the variable ```var``` holds the integer 5 instead of 10

### 1.2 different types of information in variables:

- variables can store many different types of information
- we're going to be focusing on storing numbers, booleans, and strings
- numbers can be integers like 0, 5, 1, -3 and rational numbers like 3.14, 2.5, 1.0001
- booleans are conditions: True and False -> capitalize
- strings are single characters, words, or multiple words and need to be surrounded by double quotation marks ""

```python
# example of storing numbers in variables

var1 = 12
var2 = 3.1
var3 = -1000.11

# example of storing booleans

vart = True
varf = False

# example of storing strings

vars = "hi my name is bob"
varc = "b"
variable = "yoooo"
```

### 1.3 doing math with numbers and variables

- python can do basic math calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- variables can store math expressions like 3 + 2
- PEMDAS applies in math expressions in python

```python
# example of math in python

var_stores_2 = 3 - 1
var_also_stores_2 = 2 * 1
var_also_also_stores_2 = 10 / 5
var_name_too_long = 1 + 1
```

### 1.4 variable values can change:

- variables are mutable, meaning they can change
- we change a variable by setting it equal (storing) a different value in it
- variables can store the value of other variables

```python
# example of changing what's stored in a variable

var_something = 2
var_something = 3 # now the variable holds the integer 3

# variable storing another variable's value

var_hello = "hello"
var_greeting = var_hello # var_greeting stores "hello"
```

### 1.5 printing
- printing is a way to output information from the program to the screen
- we use the ```print``` function to achieve this

```python
# examples of printing
print(2)
print("hello")
print(False)
print(1+1)

# what will be printed here?
var = 2
varx = var
print(varx)
var = 3
print(varx)
```
