# Day 16

## Topics:

plans for potential closings:
- we will be moving to an online curriculum called CodeCombat
- similar to wombatgame and allows you to do a lot at home with just a web browswer
- you'll be able to contact me and other through discord if you have questions

for people who were here saturday:
- review while loop worksheet
- draw the first letter of your name with leaves
- wombat problems for climbing over rocks

for people who weren't here saturday:
- were going to do the notes for day 15 instead

## Notes:

### codecombat:
- codecombat.com

### review while loop worksheet:

takeaways from looking over them
- you all know the basic while loop really well
- we struggle with while loops that happen 0 times or infinite amounts of times
- the text size was kind of small on some problems (i looked like a 1)  

### problem(student) draw first letter of your name in leaves:

![](/gifs/new15/b.gif)

- use setup 0

### problem(student) make the wombat climb over a randomly placed rock:

![](/gifs/new15/climb_small_wall.gif)

- use setup 6
- wombat should be at the bottom left: (0, 11)
- hint: make the wombat first get right next to the rock before climbing
    - which built-in function are you going to use?

## Homework:

None
