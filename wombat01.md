## Notes:

### 1.1 What is computer programming?

![](/pictures/day1/programming.png)

- Wikipedia definition: Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result.
- more simply you give the computer ordered instructions to do something you want
- computers are very stupid so you need to tell them exactly what you want done so they don't need to do any guessing
- past programmers have developed abstractions so that programmers today don't have to program in 1s and 0s (binary) - so we have to still be specific, but not as specific as 0s and 1s
- **programs are executed by the computer from top to bottom**

### 1.2 wombat game:

- the wombat is called "bob" in my programs but you can name he/she whatever you want
- the wombat has 7 default actions
    1. walk once in the direction it's facing -> ```bob.walk()```
    2. turn left once -> ```bob.turn_left()```
    3. place a single leaf on the spot it's standing on -> ```bob.place_leaf()```
    4. pick a single leaf on the spot it's standing on -> ```bob.pick_leaf()```
    5. detecting if it can walk one step forward and not crash into a rock or a wall -> ```bob.can_move()```
    6. detecting if it found a leaf on the spot it's currently on -> ```bob.found_leaf()```
    7. determining if it's facing north -> ```bob.facing_north()```
- the wombat will break if:
    - the wombat crashes into a rock or a wall
    - the wombat tries to pick a leaf on a spot which doesn't have a leaf
    - the wombat tries to place a leaf when it doesn't have any leaves to place
    - example:
    ![](/gifs/day1/move_until_broken.gif)
- the screen is a 16x12 grid and those dimensions will never change


### 1.3 Why wombatgame?

1. it is relatively simple - only 7 built in functions of the wombat
2. it uses a coordinate grid system for movement which should be familiar to high school students
3. it is graphical so you can see where you're going wrong/right visually
4. the problems you solve need the same logic as real-world computer programming tasks


### 1.4 Two files:

- the __only__ files you should be editing are __main.py__ and __commands.py__
- commands for the wombat go in commands.py
- the only edits you do in main.py are changing the setup variables at the top such as ```delay```, ```wombat```, and ```world```
- to run your commands you need to call your function you just created in the ```run()``` function at the bottom of commands.py

### 1.5 creating a basic function:

- a function is a collection of simple instructions to do a more complex task
- need to use the ```def``` keyword to start
- create a unique and descriptive function name
- add parenthesis to the end of the function name with the self keyword -> ```def example_name(self)```
- after the parenthesis add a colon -> :
- indent correctly inside the function to tell the computer what code belongs to the function
- this is a function which makes the wombat walk forward 5 times:
```python
def walk_5_times(self):
    bob.walk()
    bob.walk()
    bob.walk()
    bob.walk()
    bob.walk()
```

### 1.6 calling functions:

**important note**: calling functions you made uses the ```self``` keyword not ```bob```

- calling a function is telling the computer to execute all the commands within it
- if we want bob the wombat to walk forward once we need to call the walk function on him
    - we do this by saying ```bob.walk()```
- take the ```walk_5_times()``` function above and say we want bob to do those actions
    - you need to call the function in the commands.py ```run()``` function at the bottom
    - calling ```walk_5_times()``` in the ```run()``` function will look like:
    ```python
    def run(self):
        self.walk_5_times()
    ```
    - remember that you need the ```self``` keyword before your function name in the ```run()``` function
- then to execute your code, you have to run main.py


### 1.7 Running main.py in VSCode:

click the green start button in the upper right corner of your editor when you are on main.py

### 1.8 modifying starting conditions:

- the wombat can start in different cells on the screen depending on where you set the starting location
    - by default the starting location is (0, 0) which is the upper left corner
    - you can change where the wombat starts by changing ```wombat = Wombat(wombat_img, 0, 0)``` in main.py to ```wombat = Wombat(wombat_img, 0, 11)``` which would mean the wombat now starts in the bottom left corner
- you can change the world setup which is necessary for certain problems
    - by default, the world setup is 0 and is a clean board
    - change ```world = World(screen.get_size(), wombat, screen, delay, 0)``` in main.py to ```world = World(screen.get_size(), wombat, screen, delay, 1)``` if you want to change the setup to 1
- the animation speed of the wombat can be changed by going into main.py and changing the value of the variable ```delay = 0.05``` to ```delay = 0.00``` for example. (this change makes the wombat move as fast as possible)


## Homework/Classwork:

Make a program which combines a couple of the function we learned about today to do something interesting

examples:
- make a square with leaves
- make the wombat dance with turns and walks
- have a wombat drop leaves and then pick them back up

If you canâ€™t think of anything interesting to do, just play around with all of the built in functions. Get a good grasp of what each one does.

Be ready to show instructors what you have done tomorrow
