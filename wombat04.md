## Topics:

- 5-10 minutes of going over homework
- 5 minute review of what we did last class
- 5-10 minutes going over built-in wombat functions
- problem(student): make a program which solves the doors setup
- problem(student)(challenge): make a program which solves the doors setup with leaves


## Notes:

### problem(student): make a program which solves the doors setup

![](/gifs/day4/doors1.gif)

- use setup 8
- figure out how to detect a door using the wombat
- hint: you know you're done when you've gone through 8 doors


### problem(student)(challenge): make a program which solves the doors setup with leaves

- use setup 9
- now you have to check how many leaves are in a door and keep searching if the amount of leaves is not 1
- again, you know you're done when you've gone through 8 doors



## Homework:

Continue on classwork if it's not finished. Otherwise, no homework. You should spend at least an hour on the homework and you are welcome to work longer than that. Be prepared to tell your teachers what progress you made at home.
