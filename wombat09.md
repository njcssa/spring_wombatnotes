# Day 10

## Topics:

- pair work
- why pairs

## Notes:

### pair list:

|Group # | Members  |
|---|---|
1 | Ayo, Victoria
2 | Maurice, Edward, Kevin
3 | Gio, George


### why pairs:

- teaching and helping others is one of the best ways to learn
- i'll be able to rely on some of the students who are getting the material quicker to help students who need extra help
    - i'm only one person so it's good to have help
- i'll still be here to help out people but I want groups to try to be independent and solve problems internally


### problem: walk over to a pile of 10 leaves and pick them all up

![](/gifs/day2/pick_ten.gif)

- use setup 11
- you should use a loop to solve this problem
- you would want to use the built in function ```found_leaf()``` to determine if the wombat is on a square which holds the stack of leaves
- then once you determine that you are on the square, you pick them up _while_ you have _found a leaf_

### problem: make the wombat walk in a diagonal for 3 steps

- change setup variable in main.py back to 0
- i'm going to have the groups attempt this together
- if people are struggling, we'll work on it together as a class

### problem(student): make the wombat place leaves in the 3 diagonal

![](/gifs/new9/diagonal3leaf.gif)

- make a new function
- it's going to look similar to the one we created above

### problem(student): make the wombat place leaves in the 3 diagonal for the 3 other directions

- the diagonal above was for the wombat moving south east
- make a diagonal for:
    - north east
    - north west
    - south west


### problem(student): make the wombat create a leaf diamond shape

- combine your diagonal functions
