## Topics:

- 5-10 minutes of going over homework
- 5 minute review of what we did last class
- 5-10 minutes going over built-in wombat functions
- problem(student): draw first letter of your first name with leaves
- problem: climb a small wall and walk over to the other edge
- problem(student): climb over a randomly generated wall
- problem(student)(challenge): climb over mountains


## Notes:

### problem(student): draw first letter of your first name with leaves

![](/gifs/day3/b.gif)

- use setup 0

### problem: climb a small wall and walk over to the other edge

![](/gifs/day3/climb_small_wall.gif)

- use setup 6
- wombat should be at the bottom left: (0, 11)

### problem(student): climb over a randomly generated wall

![](/gifs/day3/climb_n_wall.gif)

- use setup 3
- this wall will be at a random x location and have a random height
    - therefore, your solution needs to be general to fit many different wall sizes
- hint: figure out how to determine when the wombat is at the top of the wall using the built-in functions

###problem(student)(challenge): climb over mountains

- use setup 10
- this is a really hard problem so only do this if you have some extra free time
- one of the hardest aspects is determining when you are in a valley



## Homework:

Continue on classwork if it's not finished. Otherwise, no homework. You should spend at least an hour on the homework and you are welcome to work longer than that. Be prepared to tell your teachers what progress you made at home.
