## Topics:

- 5-10 minutes of going over homework
- 5 minute review of what we did last class
- problem: make a program which places leaves at specific coordinates
- problem(student): make a program which follows a coordinate list


## Notes:

### problem: make a program which places leaves at specific coordinates

![](/gifs/day6/place_leaves_at_coords.gif)

- use setup 0
- wombat doesn't know where it is unless you keep track of coordinates for it
- for orientation, you can always walk to the upper left corner and know for a _fact_ that it is standing on (0, 0)



### problem(student): make a program which follows a coordinate list

![](/gifs/day6/follow_coords.gif)

- use setup 0
- you need to use some if statments here to compare the current coordinate location to the next and walk in a direction based on the change
- for example, if the x changes by positive 1, then the wombat must walk east
- if the x changes by negative 1, then the wombat must walk west
- if the y changes by positive 1, then the wombat must walk south
- if the y changes by negative 1, then the wombat must walk north



## Homework:

Continue on classwork if it's not finished. Otherwise, no homework. You should spend at least an hour on the homework and you are welcome to work longer than that. Be prepared to tell your teachers what progress you made at home.
