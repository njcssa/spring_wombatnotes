# Day 7 (Wednesday 7/17)

[Link to Slideshow](google.com)

## Topics:

- 5-10 minutes of going over homework
- 5 minute review of what we did last class
- appending items to a list
- problem(student): make a program which looks through whole coordinate grid and appends coordinates to a list where it finds leaves


## Notes:

### appending items to a list in python

- lists can change when the programmer adds or removes values from them
- example of adding numbers to a list
```python
num_list = []
num_list.append(1)
num_list.append(2)
num_list.append(3)
print(num_list) # will print out [1, 2, 3]
```


### problem(student): make a program which looks through whole coordinate grid and appends coordinates to a list where it finds leaves

- use setup 1
- you need to use some if statments here to compare the current coordinate location to the next and walk in a direction based on the change
- for example, if the x changes by positive 1, then the wombat must walk east
- if the x changes by negative 1, then the wombat must walk west
- if the y changes by positive 1, then the wombat must walk south
- if the y changes by negative 1, then the wombat must walk north



## Homework:

Continue on classwork if it's not finished. Otherwise, no homework. You should spend at least an hour on the homework and you are welcome to work longer than that. Be prepared to tell your teachers what progress you made at home.
