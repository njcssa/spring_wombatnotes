### Name tags

- name tags will be handed out and students will be required to wear them for the first two weeks
- since other instructors come on Saturdays, nametags will also be worn on Saturdays
- name tags will be stored at the library

### Get to know each other game:

Steps:
1. stand in a circle
2. heads facing down
3. when instructor says "up" pick your head up and look at someone else in the circle
4. if the person you're looking at is looking at you, you have to try to say their name first. otherwise you just wait for the round to be over.
5. if they beat you and say your name first, you're out and they're still in (an vice versa)
6. once the round is over place your head back down and wait for the instructor to say "up" again
7. play until their are two people left


### Rules of the class:

- ask questions - **especially** if you think they're stupid questions because all questions are good questions
- all absences should be communicated to me (ben) **prior** to the planned absence via text, email, discord, etc.
    - you are expected to make an effort to complete the work you missed at home
    - instructors will be available on Discord to help
- snacks are provided, but you have to eat them in the cafe, so **arrive early** to class if you want to eat them before class starts
- homework can be done in class if you have extra time


### Choose computers:

- the password to each is "njcssa2019"
- if a computer is acting up, i'll try to fix it or find you a new one
- fun fact - these run linux
